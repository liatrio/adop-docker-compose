This is the home of all LDOP documentation.

If you are new to the platform then the recommended reading is:

- [Prerequisites](/ldop-docker-compose/docs/prerequisites/)
- [Quickstart](/ldop-docker-compose/docs/quickstart/)
- [Architecture Overview](/ldop-docker-compose/docs/architecture/)

Once you've got a feel for things you can explore the rest!

We also suggest you check out our [recommended reading](/ldop-docker-compose/docs/recommended-reading/) list.
